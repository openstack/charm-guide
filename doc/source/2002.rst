New Charm Features
==================

With each new feature, there is a corresponding example bundle in the form of a
test bundle, and/or a `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_ section which
details the use of the feature. For example test bundles, see the
src/tests/bundles/ directory within the relevant charm repository.

Policy Overrides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The policy overrides feature provides operators with a mechanism to override
policy defaults on a per-service basis.

Policy defaults for an OpenStack service are defined via “policy-in-code”
and/or via a default policy YAML file provided by the charm. The operator can
use the new feature by providing a ZIP file consisting of at least one YAML
file which contains policy rules that the service will observe when responding
to API queries. This allows operators to selectively override the default
policies of that service.

The last release (19.10) introduced the feature for a number of charms.  This
release adds the following charms:

* openstack-dashboard (Horizon)
* octavia

For further details consult appendix `Policy Overrides`_ in the `OpenStack
Charms Deployment Guide`_.

Please consult the README for each charm to determine exactly what is provided
with respect to this feature.

Preview Charm Features
======================

mysql-innodb-cluster and mysql-router
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 20.02 OpenStack Charms release updates two tech preview charms to deploy
MySQL 8 for OpenStack: mysql-innodb-cluster and mysql-router.

.. note :: These charms are in preview state and are not production-ready. The
           charms are ready for **testing** in OpenStack clouds.

.. note :: Both charms are only deployable on Ubuntu 19.10 and greater.

The mysql-innodb-cluster charm deploys MySQL 8 in an InnoDB cluster with a
read/write node and N number of read-only nodes.

.. note :: The mysql-innodb-cluster charm is intended for deploying a cluster
           and therefore does not support single-unit or non-clustered
           deployments.

The mysql-router charm deploys MySQL 8 mysqlrouter which will proxy database
requests from the principle charm application to a MySQL 8 InnoDB Cluster.
MySQL Router handles cluster communication and understands the cluster schema.

.. note :: The mysql-router charm is deployed as a subordinate on the principle
           charm application.

A simple example deployment:

.. code:: bash

     juju deploy cs:keystone
     juju deploy cs:~openstack-charmers-next/mysql-router
     juju deploy -n 3 cs:~openstack-charmers-next/mysql-innodb-cluster
     juju add-relation mysql-router:db-router mysql-innodb-cluster:db-router

OVN
~~~

The 20.02 OpenStack Charms release updates the tech preview suite of charms
that allows you to model Open Virtual Network (OVN).  OVN provides open source
network virtualization for Open vSwitch (OVS).

One of the main drivers for this enablement work is the prospect of being able
to hardware-offload everything.  This is possible due to how OVN programs
everything in Open vSwitch with OpenFlow rules.  This in turn provides a
uniform way of programming the hardware forwarding tables of supported NICs.

Hardware-offloading is a prerequisite for effective handling of workloads with
high bandwidth consumption.

OVN also provides a more flexible way of configuring external Layer3 networking
as OVN does not require every node (``Chassis`` in OVN terminology) in a
deployment to have direct external connectivity.  This plays nicely with
Layer3-only datacenter fabrics (RFC 7938).

East/West traffic is distributed by default. North/South traffic is highly
available by default.  Liveness detection is done using the Bidirectional
Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol.

Please refer to appendix `Open Virtual Network (OVN)`_ in the `OpenStack Charms
Deployment Guide`_ for more details.

Known feature gaps at this point in time:

* No validation has been done with DPDK, SR-IOV or hardware-offloading in the
  charms.

* Support for the Octavia OVN provider driver has not been implemented in the
  charms and no validation has been done with LBaaS in general.

* Only limited validation has been done with other Neutron extensions, and it
  may be possible to configure unsupported combinations of features with
  undefined results.

* There is an unresolved issue with security groups rules that reference
  remote security groups.  Please remove any such rules while testing.

Example of how you could reset your default security group rules:

.. code:: bash

    PROJECT_ID=$(openstack project list -f value -c ID \
                   --domain admin_domain)
    SECGRP_ID=$(openstack security group list --project $PROJECT_ID \
        | awk '/default/{print$2}')
    openstack security group rule delete \
        $(openstack security group rule list $SECGRP_ID| awk '/IPv./{print$2}')
    openstack security group rule create --egress --protocol any \
        --ethertype IPv4 $SECGRP_ID
    openstack security group rule create --egress --protocol any \
        --ethertype IPv6 $SECGRP_ID
    openstack security group rule create --ingress --protocol any \
        --ethertype IPv4 $SECGRP_ID --remote-ip YOUR_IPV4_LAB_NETWORK_CIDR
    openstack security group rule create --ingress --protocol any \
        --ethertype IPv6 $SECGRP_ID --remote-ip YOUR_IPV6_LAB_NETWORK_CIDR

Upgrading charms
================

Always use the latest stable charm revision before proceeding with topological
changes, charm application migrations, workload upgrades, series upgrades, or
bug reports.

Please ensure that the ``keystone`` charm is upgraded first.

To upgrade an existing deployment to the latest charm version simply use the
``upgrade-charm`` command. For example:

.. code:: bash

    juju upgrade-charm keystone

Charm upgrades and OpenStack upgrades are functionally different. Charm
upgrades ensure that the deployment has the latest charm revision, containing
the latest charm fixes and charm features available for that deployment,
whereas OpenStack upgrades influence the software package versions of OpenStack
itself.

Charm upgrades do not trigger OpenStack upgrades. However, OpenStack upgrades
do require the latest charm version as pre-requisite.

Known Issues
============

Masakari and Masakari Monitors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Masakari charms remain as previews. Bugs `LP #1728527`_ and `LP #1839715`_
need to be resolved in order to arrive at a successful instance HA deployment.
Bug `LP #1773765`_ is likely to affect on-going support of a Masakari
deployment.

Glance Simplestreams Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deploying the ``glance-simplestreams-sync`` charm on Bionic a more recent
version of the simplestreams package must be installed by configuring a PPA:

.. code:: bash

    juju config glance-simplestreams-sync source=ppa:simplestreams-dev/trunk

See bug `LP #1790904`_ for details.

Designate and Vault at Ocata and earlier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``designate`` charm for OpenStack releases Pike and earlier does not yet
support SSL via Vault and the certificates relation. See bug `LP #1839019
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/charm-designate/+bug/1839019>`__

Current versions of OpenStack with Vault and the certificates relation are
supported by the Designate charm.

Restart Nova services after adding certificates relation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A race condition exists with the use of the 'certificates' relation.
When SSL certificates are issued Nova services may attempt to talk
to the placement API over HTTP while the API has already changed to
HTTPS. See bug `LP #1826382 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1826382>`__.

To mitigate against this, restart nova-compute and nova-scheduler
services once certificates have been issued:

.. code:: bash

    juju run --application nova-compute "systemctl restart nova-compute"
    juju run --application nova-cloud-controller "systemctl restart nova-scheduler"

Bugs Fixed
==========

This release includes NNN bug fixes. For the full list of bugs resolved for the
20.02 charms release please refer to the `20.02 milestone`_ in Launchpad.

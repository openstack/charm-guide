New stable charms

New stable charm features
-------------------------

With each new feature, there is a corresponding example bundle in the form of a
test bundle, and/or a section in the current guide (Charm Guide) that details
its usage. Test bundles are located in the ``src/tests/bundles`` directory of
the relevant charm repository (see all `charm repositories`_).

Keystone role cache config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keystone charm now supports configuring the keystone [role] cache_time using
a new role-cache-expiration config. If not set, this defaults to the global
expiration_time (configurable by the dogpile-cache-expiration config option). Setting
the role cache_time to something closer to 10s is recommended for
clouds that receive frequent role assignment changes and are sensitive to the
(default) 600s delay that assignements can take to propagate to all keystone
peer caches.

For example, to set the role cache expiration time to 10 seconds do:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config keystone role-cache-expiration=10

The result of this being that keystone will only used cached role assignments for up to
10 seconds before refreshing them from the database.

Designate-bind allow transfer config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The designate-bind charm now supports configuring BIND9 ``allow-transfer``.
If not set, this defaults to none, which disable allow-transfer.

For example, to set BIND9 allow-transfer to ``10.0.0.0/8`` and ``172.16.0.0/16``:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config designate-bind allow_transfer_nets="10.0.0.0/8;172.16.0.0/12"

This will allow designate-bind to perform zone transfer to ``10.0.0.0/8`` and ``172.16.0.0/12``.

Please note that this change modifies the default behaviour of the
BIND9 ``allow-transfer`` setting.
To restore the default behaviour, set ``allow-transfer`` to ``any``:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config designate-bind allow_transfer_nets=any

Improve Vault snap channel refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snap channel refresh for the Vault snap in charm-vault has been improved to properly
stop the service before performing a snap refresh.
For more details see bug `LP #2007587`_.

Glance custom image properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The glance charm now supports configuring automatic custom image properties for imported images.
The specified properties will be automatically added to all images that go through the `interoperable image import`_
process.

To add the custom properties use a comma delimited string of ``key:value`` pairs as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config glance custom-import-properties='property1:value1,property2:value2,property3:value3'

Note properties will only be added to images that go through the import process such as ``openstack image create --import``
but will not be applied to regular image uploads.

Juju 3.x incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keystone and glance-simplestreams-sync legacy charms (not using channels),
and stable channels Xena and before, do not work with a Juju 3.x controller.
The problems arising from upgrading these charms so that they (automatically)
use Juju 3.x unit agents are related to:

* Fernet key rotations (keystone)
* status setting and endpoint updating (glance-simplestreams-sync)

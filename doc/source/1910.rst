New Charm Features
==================

With each new feature, there is a corresponding example bundle in the form of a
test bundle, and/or a `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_ section which
details the use of the feature. For example test bundles, see the
src/tests/bundles/ directory within the relevant charm repository.

OpenStack Train
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 19.10 OpenStack Charms release introduces support for OpenStack Train on
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (via UCA) and Ubuntu 19.10.

Please note the placement charm must be deployed and related to the
``nova-cloud-controller`` charm as of OpenStack Train. See section `Placement
Charm`_ for more details.

nova-cloud-controller: instance migration - DNS caching is now the default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This has nothing to do with Designate or Neutron DNS.

The 19.07 release introduced the option to enable caching of DNS lookups of the
nova-compute units which are used by nova to perform migrations of tenant
instances between nova-compute units. This was not enabled by default. The
19.10 release "flips the switch" and enables this option by default so that
after upgrade, if the option was not explicitly set, DNS results will be cached
automatically. New clouds will also, unless the option is explicitly set to
false, cache DNS host lookups.

The reason for caching DNS host lookups is to reduce the time to add
nova-compute units to an existing cloud, or during first deployment.

Please see the config option ``cache-known-hosts`` on the
``nova-cloud-controller`` charm for further details.

Policy Overrides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Policy Overrides feature provides operators with a mechanism to override
policy defaults on a per-service basis.

Policy defaults for an OpenStack service are defined via "policy-in-code"
and/or via a default policy YAML file provided by the charm. The operator can
use the new feature by providing a ZIP file consisting of at least one YAML
file which contains policy rules that the service will observe when responding
to API queries. This allows operators to selectively override the default
policies of that service.

This feature is being provided in the following charms:

- cinder
- designate
- glance
- keystone
- neutron-api
- nova-cloud-controller

For further details consult appendix `Policy Overrides`_ in the `OpenStack
Charms Deployment Guide`_.

Please consult the README for each charm to determine exactly what is provided
with respect to this feature.

Ceph Nautilus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Along with OpenStack Train, the 19.10 charm release includes support for the
Nautilus release of Ceph.

Ceph Placement Group Autotuning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Ceph Nautilus, the OpenStack Charms now support autotuning of placement
groups. The new pg_autoscaler module allows the cluster to consider the amount
of data stored, or expected, in each pool and manage the correct pg_num values
automatically.

This feature can be disabled entirely by setting a new configuration option,
pg-autotune, to "false". This option defaults to "auto" which will cause new
deployments on Ceph Nautilus to enable the autoscaler, but older releases
upgraded to Nautilus will need to explicitly opt-in by setting pg-autotune to
"true".

Neutron Port Forwarding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neutron Port forwarding extension can now be optionally enabled with 19.10
charms for OpenStack Rocky and later. Be aware that the Train openstack-client
version (or later) may be required in order to interact with the feature from
the command line.

For more information on this feature see the `Neutron documentation`_.

Migration to FQDN for agent registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with the 19.10 charms when deploying OpenStack Stein or newer, the
Nova Compute agent as deployed by the ``nova-compute`` charm and Neutron agents
as deployed by the ``neutron-openvswitch`` charm will use a fully qualified
domain name (FQDN) when registering with the API services.

As the name an agent registers with is referenced across multiple services in a
OpenStack cloud this change will only apply to newly deployed units. Upgrading
the above two charms or upgrading OpenStack will not trigger the new behaviour.

The backdrop of the change is:

- Fix bugs in third party services relating to consistency of hypervisor naming
  in Nova.

- Avoid deploy time issues in the event a node is configured without a search
  domain, and also support clouds with a segregated DNS layout.

- Switch to a more sensible default mode of operation enabling easier
  integration with new technologies such as OVN.

Ceph RADOS Gateway tenant namespacing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ceph-radosgw`` charm now supports deployment with tenant namespaces.
This is enabled during initial deployment using the ``namespace-tenants``
configuration option. Enabling this option post deployment will have no effect
as it is not possible to migrate a deployment without tenant namespacing to one
with tenant namespacing enabled.

Endpoint URLs for object storage will contain the tenant ID in the form:

.. code:: bash

    http://<cephradosgw-unit-ip-or-vip>:80/swift/v1/AUTH_<tenant-id>

This feature allows per-tenant bucket namespaces, rather than a global bucket
namespace, which is aligned to the behaviour of OpenStack Swift.

Placement Charm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 19.10 OpenStack Charms release introduces a new charm for the placement
API. The `placement API`_ service was extracted from the Nova project in
OpenStack Train and moved to its own project. Therefore, the new ``placement``
charm must be deployed and related to the ``nova-cloud-controller`` charm for
OpenStack Train deployments. See section `Upgrading OpenStack`_ for more
details on how to introduce the placement charm into existing deployments when
upgrading to OpenStack Train.

Cinder Integration with Pure Storage Array
------------------------------------------

The 19.10 OpenStack Charms release introduces a new charm which can be used
to integrate cinder with a Pure Storage array. To use the new subordinate
charm:

.. code:: bash

    juju deploy cinder
    juju deploy cinder-purestorage
    juju add-relation cinder-purestorage cinder

The cinder-purestorage charm needs to be configured with the IP address of the
storage array and provided with an API token for authentication.
Typically the settings that need configuring are:

.. code:: yaml

    protocol: iscsi
    volume-backend-name: cinder-pure
    san-ip: PURESTORAGE_IP
    pure-api-token: API_TOKEN


Preview Charm Features
======================

mysql-innodb-cluster and mysql-router
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 19.10 OpenStack Charms release introduces two new charms to deploy MySQL 8
for OpenStack: mysql-innodb-cluster and mysql-router.

.. note :: These charms are in preview state and are not production-ready. The
           charms are ready for **testing** in OpenStack clouds.

.. note :: Both charms are only deployable on Ubuntu 19.10 and greater.

The mysql-innodb-cluster charm deploys MySQL 8 in an InnoDB cluster with a
read/write node and N number of read-only nodes.

.. note :: The mysql-innodb-cluster charm is intended for deploying a cluster
           and therefore does not support single-unit or non-clustered
           deployments.

The mysql-router charm deploys MySQL 8 mysqlrouter which will proxy database
requests from the principle charm application to a MySQL 8 InnoDB Cluster.
MySQL Router handles cluster communication and understands the cluster schema.

.. note :: The mysql-router charm is deployed as a subordinate on the principle
           charm application.

A simple example deployment:

.. code:: bash

     juju deploy cs:keystone
     juju deploy cs:~openstack-charmers-next/mysql-router
     juju deploy -n 3 cs:~openstack-charmers-next/mysql-innodb-cluster
     juju add-relation mysql-router:db-router mysql-innodb-cluster:db-router


Upgrading charms
================

Always use the latest stable charm revision before proceeding with topological
changes, charm application migrations, workload upgrades, series upgrades, or
bug reports.

Please ensure that the ``keystone`` charm is upgraded first.

To upgrade an existing deployment to the latest charm version simply use the
``upgrade-charm`` command. For example:

.. code:: bash

    juju upgrade-charm keystone

Charm upgrades and OpenStack upgrades are functionally different. Charm
upgrades ensure that the deployment has the latest charm revision, containing
the latest charm fixes and charm features available for that deployment,
whereas OpenStack upgrades influence the software package versions of OpenStack
itself.

Charm upgrades do not trigger OpenStack upgrades. However, OpenStack upgrades
do require the latest charm version as pre-requisite.

Upgrading OpenStack
===================

.. note::

   Upgrading an OpenStack cloud is not without risk; upgrades should be tested
   in pre-production testing environments prior to production deployment
   upgrades.

See appendix `OpenStack Upgrades`_ in the `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_
for more details.

Before upgrading OpenStack, all OpenStack Charms should be running the latest
stable charm revision.

To upgrade an existing Stein-based deployment on Ubuntu 18.04 to the Train
release, re-configure the charm with a new openstack-origin configuration. For
example:

.. code:: bash

    juju config nova-compute openstack-origin=cloud:bionic-train

As of Train, the placement API is managed by the new ``placement`` charm and is
no longer managed by the ``nova-cloud-controller`` charm. The upgrade to Train
therefore requires some coordination to transition to the new API endpoints.

Prior to upgrading nova-cloud-controller to Train, the placement charm must be
deployed for Train and related to the Stein-based nova-cloud-controller. It is
important that the nova-cloud-controller unit leader is paused while the API
transition occurs (paused prior to adding relations for the placement charm) as
the placement charm will migrate existing placement tables from the nova_api
database to a new placement database. Once the new placement endpoints are
registered, nova-cloud-controller can be resumed.

Here's an example of the steps just described:

.. code:: bash

    juju deploy --series bionic --config openstack-origin=cloud:bionic-train cs:placement
    juju run-action nova-cloud-controller/leader pause
    juju add-relation placement mysql
    juju add-relation placement keystone
    juju add-relation placement nova-cloud-controller
    openstack endpoint list # ensure placement endpoints are listening on new placment IP address
    juju run-action nova-cloud-controller/leader resume

Only after these steps have been completed can nova-cloud-controller be
upgraded. Here we upgrade all units simultaneously but see `HA with
pause/resume`_ in the `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_ for a more
controlled approach:

.. code:: bash

    juju config nova-cloud-controller openstack-origin=cloud:bionic-train

New Bundle Features
===================

Deprecation Notices
===================

Removed Features
================

Ceph Nautilus has removed support for directory backed OSDs. The charms will
allow for the creation of directory backed OSDs on older Ceph releases but will
log a warning about their use from Nautilus onwards. Existing directory backed
OSDs will continue to function after an upgrade to Nautilus.

Known Issues
============

Masakari and Masakari Monitors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Masakari charms remain as previews. Bugs `LP #1728527`_ and `LP #1839715`_
need to be resolved in order to arrive at a successful instance HA deployment.
Bug `LP #1773765`_ is likely to affect on-going support of a Masakari
deployment.

Glance Simplestreams Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deploying the ``glance-simplestreams-sync`` charm on Bionic a more recent
version of the simplestreams package must be installed by configuring a PPA:

.. code:: bash

    juju config glance-simplestreams-sync source=ppa:simplestreams-dev/trunk

See bug `LP #1790904`_ for details.

Bugs Fixed
==========

This release includes NNN bug fixes. For the full list of bugs resolved for the
19.10 charms release please refer to the `19.10 milestone`_ in Launchpad.

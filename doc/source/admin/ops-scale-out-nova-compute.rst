======================================
Scale out the nova-compute application
======================================

Preamble
--------

Scaling out the nova-compute application implies the addition of one or more
nova-compute units (i.e. compute nodes). It is a straightforward operation
that should not incur any cloud downtime.

Procedure
---------

Check the current state of the cloud, scale out by adding a single compute
node, and verify the new node.

Current state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gather basic information about the current state of the cloud in terms of the
nova-compute application:

.. code-block:: none

   juju status nova-compute

Below is sample output from an OVN-based cloud. This example cloud has a single
nova-compute unit:

.. code-block:: console

Display the name of the current compute host:

.. code-block:: none

   openstack host list

   +---------------------+-----------+----------+
   | Host Name           | Service   | Zone     |
   +---------------------+-----------+----------+
   | juju-616a7f-0-lxd-3 | conductor | internal |
   | juju-616a7f-0-lxd-3 | scheduler | internal |
   | node1.maas          | compute   | nova     |
   +---------------------+-----------+----------+

Scale out
~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``add-unit`` command to scale out the nova-compute application.
Multiple units can be added with the use of the ``-n`` option.

.. note::

   If the node has specific hardware-related requirements (e.g. storage) it
   will need to be manually attended to first (within MAAS) and then targeted
   with the ``--to`` option.

   The new unit can also be placed on an existing Juju machine (co-located with
   another application). In this case, if the ``--to`` option is used it will
   refer to the machine ID.

Here we add a single unit onto a new machine (MAAS node):

.. code-block:: none

   juju add-unit --to node4.maas nova-compute

The status output should eventually look similar to:

.. code-block:: console

Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify that the new compute node is functional by creating a VM on it.

First confirm that the new compute host is known to the cloud:

.. code-block:: none

   openstack host list

   +---------------------+-----------+----------+
   | Host Name           | Service   | Zone     |
   +---------------------+-----------+----------+
   | juju-616a7f-0-lxd-3 | conductor | internal |
   | juju-616a7f-0-lxd-3 | scheduler | internal |
   | node1.maas          | compute   | nova     |
   | node4.maas          | compute   | nova     |
   +---------------------+-----------+----------+

Then create a VM by targeting the new host, in this case 'node4.maas'. Note
that a minimum Nova API Microversion is required (the cloud admin role is
needed to specify this):

.. code-block:: none

   openstack --os-compute-api-version 2.74 server create \
      --image focal-amd64 --flavor m1.micro --key-name admin-key \
      --network int_net --host node4.maas \
      focal-2

Confirm that the new node is being used (information only available to the
cloud admin by default):

.. code-block:: none

   openstack server show focal-2 | grep hypervisor

   | OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hypervisor_hostname | node4.maas

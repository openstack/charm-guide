<TITLE>

New stable charm features
-------------------------

With each new feature, there is a corresponding example bundle in the form of a
test bundle, and/or a section in the current guide (Charm Guide) that details
its usage. Test bundles are located in the ``src/tests/bundles`` directory of
the relevant charm repository (see all `charm repositories`_).

manila charm: add support to configure scheduler default filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manila charm has a new configuration option `scheduler-default-filters`.
This configures the `scheduler_default_filters` parameter in manila
configuration file.

This is unset by default, so manila retains the default value for
`scheduler_default_filters`. Those might change based on OpenStack release.

For more details see bug `LP #1998200`_.

Add support for Keystone audit middleware API logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The charms listed below have a new configuration option `audit-middleware`.
This option enables or disables Keystone audit middleware functionality that
allows the user to audit API requests and configure their environment for CADF
compliance (see `keystone audit middleware`_). This option is disabled by
default to prevent log file bloat. The following charms support this feature,
with the respective audit log file write locations:

* **charm-cinder:** `/var/log/apache2/cinder_error.log`
* **charm-glance:** `/var/log/glance/glance-api.log`
* **charm-heat:** `/var/log/heat/heat-api.log`
* **charm-neutron-api:** `/var/log/neutron/neutron-server.log`
* **charm-nova-cloud-controller:** `/var/log/nova/nova-api-wsgi.log`

For more details see bug `LP #1856555`_.

ironic charm: add support for OVN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack Ironic now supports OVN as the configured SDN of choice. The
neutron-api, neutron-api-plugin-ovn, neutron-api-plugin-ironic charms have been
updated to support the necessary services and drivers to use OVN instead of Open
vSwitch. To use this feature, deploy OVN services and ensure that both the
neutron-api-plugin-ovn and neutron-api-plugin-ironic are deployed.

For more details see the `Ironic documentation`_ for OpenStack charms.

gnocchi charm: add config to customize memcached heartbeat timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The heartbeat expiry timeout is hardcoded to 5 seconds and that may not be
enough to prevent the lock from expiring. A new configuration option was added
to allow customizing the value.

It's possible to adjust the timeout by running:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config gnocchi memcached-coordinator-lock-timeout=10

For more details see bug `LP #1907243`_.

glance-simplestreams-sync charm: make the GPG validation keyring configurable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a new configuration option ``custom_keyring`` which allows the user to
provide a custom GPG keyring for validating the simplestreams source, instead of
the default ``/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg``.

It's possible to use a custom keyring in the file ``my-keyring.gpg`` by running:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config glance-simplestreams-sync custom_keyring=$(base64 ./my-keyring.gpg)

octavia charm: add config options for volume-based amphora
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default launched amphorae will use ephemeral storage as defined by the flavor
used, this is suboptimal for environments where live-migration is desired (and
avoiding the transfer of the blockstorage is needed), but also provides some
resiliency in case of hypervisor failures.

The octavia charm has three new configuration options:

* ``enable-volume-based-amphora``, when this option is enabled, Octavia will
  create a volume and attach it to the amphora
* ``volume-size`` specifies the size of the volume, in GB, for amphora
  instances. Applies only when ``enable-volume-based-amphora`` is ``True``.
* ``volume-type`` specifies the type of volume for amphora volume root disk.
  Applies only when enable-volume-based-amphora is ``True``. If this isn't
  specified, the ``default_volume_type`` from ``cinder.conf`` will be used.

manila-netapp charm: add goodness-function config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This configuration option allows specifying functions that further optimize the
scheduling of shares across backend stanzas.

This is needed due to a netapp-driver specific problem when using
SVM scoped accounts. It does not have enough permissions to obtain
the ``total_capacity_gb`` information, so it cannot calculate utilization,
and therefore the goodness_function always returns 50 and end up
scheduling shares always to the same pool.

It's possible to use a goodness function based on the free capacity by running:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config manila-netapp goodness-function="(capabilities.free_capacity_gb / 1000)"

For more details see `LP #2073537`_.

keystone-saml-mellon charm: improve compatibility with Chromium-based browsers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mod_auth_mellon 0.18.0 changed the default behavior (see `5a629a1`_) of
cross-site cookies by allowing all if unset. Some IDP providers use cross-site
cookies to authenticate. Chromium-based browsers reject insecure cross-site
cookies.

Adding config option to optionally enable Secure HTTPS cookies so it can work
with Chromium-based browsers as long as the IDP connection is HTTPS.

.. code-block:: none

   juju config keystone-saml-mellon allow-cross-site-cookies=True

For more details see `LP #2068654`_.

keystone charm: disable cache by default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the architecture of how memcache gets deployed with each unit of
Keystone, it's possible for the cache on different units to become inconsistent.

This results in non-deterministic behaviors depending on which Keystone unit
services an API request.

Disable caching by default to ensure consistency and security within a
deployment; Operators may choose to enable caching and can reduce the impact of
cache unit inconsistency by tuning the expiration configuration options from the
default of 600 seconds.

It's possible to turn the cache on by running:

.. code-block:: none

   juju config keystone enable-cache=True

For more details see bug `LP #2089616`_.

ceilometer charm: add missing region setting in service_credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add region name when rendering ``ceilometer.conf``.


Ironic: re-enable legacy RBAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ironic went into `Secure RBAC by default`_ in the 2024.1 (Caracal)
release. This is causing issues with zaza-openstack-tests[2] which uses a
project scoped token. Even when z-o-t can be modified to use a system scoped
token, this opens the question if we should allow charm-ironic-api to configure
Secure RBAC or not.

This change sets enforce_scope and enforce_new_defaults to False in the
ironic-conductor and ironic-api charms to give a seamless upgrade experience to
operators since Charmed OpenStack hasn't implemented Secure RBAC support accross
the board.

For more details see the `Ironic upgrade notes`_.

nova-compute charm: make cloud-compute hostname same as nova.conf host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid inconsistency between the fqdn added to the ``nova.conf`` 'host' config
and the hostname set of the cloud-compute relation, it was needed to ensure that
both are using the same means of determining the host fqdn. This is so that when
nova-cloud-controller charm populates ssh known_hosts and shares with all
computes it definitely contains an entry for the ``nova.conf`` host config since
this is sometimes used as part of a live-migration.

For more details see `LP #2089781`_.

openstack-dashboard charm: set X-Frame-Options header to sameorigin for https
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the header ``X-Frame-Options`` is set to deny, then operations cannot be
performed from the network topology page as the ``<svg>`` tag is a kind of
``<embed>`` and access is restricted from there. This was previously set only
for the HTTP virtual host (commit `ef031d4`_).

For more details see `LP #2077024`_.

keystone-openidc charm: fix JSONDecodeError from misconfigured OIDCRedirectURI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change makes the ``OIDCRedirectURI`` be set to a unused URI. If
``OIDCRedirectURI`` matches a real Keystone federation auth endpoint, the
Keystone federation auth workflow gets interrupted making the authentication
process fail.

For more details see `LP #2075349`_.

nova-compute charm: do not render console config for s390x
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remote console access protocols such as spice, novnc, etc. are not supported on
s390x, so they are no longer enabled in ``nova.conf`` as this causes Nova to
error.

For more details see `LP #2063190`_

manila-ganesha charm: use client cert for keystone-identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When manila-ganesha is related to the vault charm, it needs a client cert to
configure the ``[keystone-auth]`` section of ``manila.conf`` to communicate with
Keystone. This change sets that up and removes the broken server cert auto
configuration which ended up masking the manila-share service.

For more details see `LP #2064487`_.

designate charm: stop apache2 when the unit is paused
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the designate units are paused via the ``pause`` action, the apache2
service is now stopped, this allows the API port to get closed and prevents
false positive checks.

For more details see `LP #2067285`_

keystone charm: add service role to service users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Secure RBAC work adds a service role which is utilized in some policies for
various services (e.g. neutron requires the service role for updating port
binding information). The keystone charm now adds the ``service`` role to all
the service users created through the ``identity-credentials`` relation.

neutron-api charm: enable more recent DNS extensions (dns-integration-domain-keywords)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since yoga, there have been two "additions" to the DNS extensions, which
simply build on top of the older ones. By changing the DNS extension to
be the latest (dns-integration-domain-keywords), all 4 extensions will
be activated:

* ``dns-integration`` (already included)
* ``dns-domain-ports`` (the previous default extension)
* ``subnet-dns-publish-fixed-ip``
* ``dns-integration-domain-keywords``

These extensions are required to enable replacement of keywords in DNS
entries and allow publishing fixed IPs without restrictions.

For more details see `Designate documentation Neutron integration`_.

Issues discovered during this release cycle
-------------------------------------------

Leader-settings-changed hook failed, cluster_status exit code 64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In environments where the rabbitmq-server units are running in resource
constrained machines, there could be a hook failures due to the fact that the
rabbitmq-server daemon hasn't fully started and the charm can't query the state
of the cluste. The symptom of an affected system is that the unit's log will
contain the following error:

.. code-block:: none

   [...]
   unit-rabbitmq-server-2: 08:48:11 WARNING unit.rabbitmq-server/2.leader-settings-changed raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args,
   unit-rabbitmq-server-2: 08:48:11 WARNING unit.rabbitmq-server/2.leader-settings-changed subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['/usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl', 'cluster_status', '--formatter=json']' returned non-zero exit status 64.
   unit-rabbitmq-server-2: 08:48:12 ERROR juju.worker.uniter.operation hook "leader-settings-changed" (via explicit, bespoke hook script) failed: exit status 1

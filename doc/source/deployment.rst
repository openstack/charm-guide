Charm Deployment
================

In order to test or develop using the OpenStack charms, you'll need to prepare
an environment where you can deploy and test OpenStack services deployed using
charms.

This part of the Charm guide details methods for getting started in this area,
with anything from a single laptop, through to a full multi-server environment
managed using MAAS.

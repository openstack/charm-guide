Getting started
===============

In order to develop an OpenStack charm you'll need a working Charmed OpenStack
environment. See the `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_ for deployment (and
charm usage) information. Alternatively, the `OpenStack on LXD`_ repository has
instructions for deploying a cloud on a single host with just LXD containers.

To learn specifically about OpenStack charms and bundles see the
:doc:`OpenStack charms and bundles <charms-and-bundles>` page. For charm and
bundle guidance of a generic nature see the `Juju documentation`_.

New Charm Features
==================

ceph-radosgw: multisite replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ceph-radosgw charm now features support for replication between RADOS Gateway
deployments; please refer to `Appendix J <https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/charm-deployment-guide/latest/app-rgw-multisite.html>`_
of the charm deployment guide for more details.

Upgrading charms
================

Please ensure that the keystone charm is upgraded first.

To upgrade an existing deployment to the latest charm version simply use the
'upgrade-charm' command, for example:

.. code:: bash

    juju upgrade-charm keystone

Charm upgrades and OpenStack upgrades are two distinctly different things. Charm upgrades ensure that the deployment is using the latest charm revision, containing the latest charm fixes and charm features available for a given deployment.

Charm upgrades do not cause OpenStack versions to upgrade, however OpenStack upgrades do require the latest Charm version as pre-requisite.

Upgrading OpenStack
===================

To upgrade an existing Queens based deployment on Ubuntu 18.04 to the Rocky
release, re-configure the charm with a new openstack-origin
configuration:

.. code:: bash

    juju config nova-cloud-controller openstack-origin=cloud:bionic-rocky

Please ensure that ceph services are upgraded before services that consume ceph
resources, such as cinder, glance and nova-compute:

.. code:: bash

    juju config ceph-mon source=cloud:bionic-rocky
    juju config ceph-osd source=cloud:bionic-rocky

.. note::

   Upgrading an OpenStack cloud is still not without risk; upgrades should
   be tested in pre-production testing environments prior to production deployment
   upgrades.

See https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/charm-deployment-guide/latest/app-upgrade-openstack.html for more details.

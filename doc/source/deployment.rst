Charm deployment
================

In order to develop an OpenStack charm you'll first need a Juju-deployed
OpenStack cloud as a working environment. The `OpenStack Charms Deployment
Guide`_ provides guidance on how to deploy OpenStack with Juju, MAAS, and the
OpenStack charms. Alternatively, the `OpenStack on LXD`_ repository has
instructions on deploying a cloud on a single host with just LXD containers.

The :ref:`Deploying from the Charm Store <charm_store>` page describes the
basics on deploying a bundle or charm from the online Charm Store.

OpenStack Charms
================

OpenStack Charms are a collection of Charmed Operators used to deploy and
manage enterprise grade OpenStack clouds using `MAAS`_ and `Juju`_, simplifying
the deployment and operations of OpenStack.

Charmed Operators, also called simply "charms", contain specific knowledge for
deployment and lifecycle management of applications and services. As such, you
will find the OpenStack charms collection consists of one charm per OpenStack
service as well as key services critical to a production grade OpenStack cloud,
such as RabbitMQ and MySQL.

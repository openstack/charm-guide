OpenStack Charms
================

The OpenStack charms are a collection of Charmed Operators used to deploy and
manage OpenStack clouds using `MAAS`_ and `Juju`_.

Charmed Operators, also called simply "charms", contain specific knowledge for
deployment and lifecycle management of applications and services. The OpenStack
charms collection consists of one charm per OpenStack service, and also
includes non-OpenStack services critical to the cloud, such as RabbitMQ and
MySQL.

Deploying and managing an OpenStack cloud is acknowledged among IT
professionals to be a challenging endeavour. The charms reduce the complexity
traditionally imposed upon cloud administrators by doing the heavy lifting.

The OpenStack Charms project is designed to meet the needs of cloud
administrators of varying skill levels. It is appropriate for both large
enterprise-grade deployments as well as small development clouds.

Making a change
===============

So you've found a bug, or want to implement a new feature.  OpenStack charms
use git-gerrit to control the addition (committing changes) to the various
repositories.  Outlined below is the *general* approach to making changes.

There are two different architectural approaches to the OpenStack charms:
*charm-helpers charms*, and *charms.openstack reactive, layered, charms*.
charm-helpers-style charms have an extra *gotcha* when it comes to syncing new
versions of charm-helpers to the charm.  Please see the note at the end.

Development Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Broadly the work flow for making a change to a charm is:

.. code:: bash

    git clone http://github.com/openstack/charm-cinder
    cd charm-cinder
    git checkout -b bug/XXXXXX master

Make the changes you need within the charm, and then run unit and pep8 tests using tox:

.. code:: bash

    tox

resolve any problems this throws up, and then commit your changes:

.. code:: bash

    git add .
    git commit

Commit messages should have an appropriate title, and more detail in the body; they
can also refer to bugs:

.. code:: bash

    Closes-Bug: #######
    Partial-Bug: #######
    Related-Bug: #######

Gerrit will automatically link your proposal to the bug reports on launchpad and
mark them fix committed when changes are merged.

Execute pep8 and unit tests:

.. code:: bash

    tox

Finally, submit your change for review (if they pass pep8 and unit tests!):

.. code:: bash

    git review

This will push your proposed changes to Gerrit and provide you with a URL for the
review board on http://review.openstack.org/.

To make amendments to your proposed change, update your local branch and then:

.. code:: bash

    git commit --amend
    git review

Stable charm updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any update to a stable charm must first be applied into the master branch; it should
then be cherry-picked in a review for the stable branch corresponding to your target
release (ensuring that any interim releases have the fix landed):

.. code:: bash

    git checkout -b stable/bug/XXXX origin/stable/YYYY
    git cherry-pick -x <hash of master branch commit>
    git review

Where XXXX is the launchpad bug ID corresponding to the fix you want to backport and
YYYY is the release name you are targeting e.g. 16.04

.. note:: when cherry-picking a commit and/or modifying the commit message, always ensure that
          the original Change-Id is left intact.

charm-helpers style charms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a charm-helpers style charm, **charm-helpers** is synced into the charm using
a *make* command.  Inspecting the ``Makefile`` of, say, `charm-keystone
<https://github.com/openstack/charm-keystone>`_ shows:

.. code:: Makefile

    sync: bin/charm_helpers_sync.py
        @$(PYTHON) bin/charm_helpers_sync.py -c charm-helpers-hooks.yaml
        @$(PYTHON) bin/charm_helpers_sync.py -c charm-helpers-tests.yaml

This command takes code from the `charm-helpers
<https://launchpad.net/charm-helpers>`_ repository on `Launchpad
<https://launchpad.net/>`_ and syncs it into the charm.  Therefore, **any**
changes done in the ``charmhelpers`` or ``tests/charmhelpers`` directories will
be overwritten during the next sync (which is performed on the charms
automatically at the end of each development cycle).  Note, that although the
project is called "charm-helpers", the directories are named 'charmhelpers'.

Therefore, in order to make changes to the charm-helpers library, this needs to
be done in the separate charm-helpers project and then synced into the charm
using a ``make sync`` command.

From a development work flow perspective, it is *easiest* to first make changes
directly in the ``charmhelpers`` directories in the charm being modified, and
once that is working, then make changes in the charm-helpers project and submit
that as a change.  Then, when the change is committed, it can be synced back
into the charm.

Note, that it is not often that changes are needed in charm-helpers unless they
are core features of all of the related charms.

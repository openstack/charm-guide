Ceph RADOS Gateway multisite replication
========================================

Overview
++++++++

Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) native replication between ceph-radosgw applications
is supported both within a single model and between different models. By
default, each application will accept write operations.

.. note::

   Multisite replication is supported starting with Ceph Luminous.

.. warning::

   Converting from a standalone deployment to a replicated deployment is not
   supported.

Deployment
++++++++++

.. note::

    Example bundles for the us-west and us-east models can be found
    in the `bundles` subdirectory of the ceph-radosgw charm.

To deploy the ceph-radosgw charm in this configuration ensure that the
following configuration options are set on the instances of the ceph-radosgw
deployed - in this example `rgw-us-east` and `rgw-us-west` are both instances
of the ceph-radosgw charm:

.. code::

    rgw-us-east:
      realm: replicated
      zonegroup: us
      zone: us-east
    rgw-us-west:
      realm: replicated
      zonegroup: us
      zone: us-west

.. note::

    The realm and zonegroup configuration must be identical between instances
    of the ceph-radosgw application participating in the multi-site
    deployment; the zone configuration must be unique per application.

When deploying with this configuration the ceph-radosgw applications will
deploy into a blocked state until the master/slave (cross-model) relation
is added.

Typically each ceph-radosgw deployment will be associated with a separate
ceph cluster at different physical locations - in this example the deployments
are in different models ('us-east' and 'us-west').

One ceph-radosgw application acts as the initial master for the deployment -
setup the master relation endpoint as the provider of the offer for the
cross-model relation:

.. code::

    juju offer -m us-east rgw-us-east:master

The cross-model relation offer can then be consumed in the other model and
related to the slave ceph-radosgw application:

.. code::

    juju consume -m us-west admin/us-east.rgw-us-east
    juju add-relation -m us-west rgw-us-west:slave rgw-us-east:master

Once the relation has been added the realm, zonegroup and zone configuration
will be created in the master deployment and then synced to the slave
deployment.

The current sync status can be validated from either model:

.. code::

    juju ssh -m us-east ceph-mon/0
    sudo radosgw-admin sync status
              realm 142eb39c-67c4-42b3-9116-1f4ffca23964 (replicated)
          zonegroup 7b69f059-425b-44f5-8a21-ade63c2034bd (us)
               zone 4ee3bc39-b526-4ac9-a233-64ebeacc4574 (us-east)
      metadata sync no sync (zone is master)
          data sync source: db876cf0-62a8-4b95-88f4-d0f543136a07 (us-west)
                            syncing
                            full sync: 0/128 shards
                            incremental sync: 128/128 shards
                            data is caught up with source

Once the deployment is complete, the default zone and zonegroup can
optionally be tidied using the 'tidydefaults' action:

.. code::

    juju run-action -m us-west --unit rgw-us-west/0 tidydefaults

.. warning::

    This operation is not reversible.

Failover/Recovery
+++++++++++++++++

In the event that the site hosting the zone which is the master for metadata
(in this example us-east) has an outage, the master metadata zone must be
failed over to the slave site; this operation is performed using the 'promote'
action:

.. code::

    juju run-action -m us-west --wait rgw-us-west/0 promote

Once this action has completed, the slave site will be the master for metadata
updates and the deployment will accept new uploads of data.

Once the failed site has been recovered it will resync and resume as a slave
to the promoted master site (us-west in this example).

The master metadata zone can be failed back to its original location once resync
has completed using the 'promote' action:

.. code::

    juju run-action -m us-east --wait rgw-us-east/0 promote

Read/write vs Read-only
-----------------------

By default all zones within a deployment will be read/write capable but only
the master zone can be used to create new containers.

Non-master zones can optionally be marked as read-only by using the 'readonly'
action:

.. code::

    juju run-action -m us-east --wait rgw-us-east/0 readonly

a zone that is currently read-only can be switched to read/write mode by either
promoting it to be the current master or by using the 'readwrite' action:

.. code::

    juju run-action -m us-east --wait rgw-us-east/0 readwrite

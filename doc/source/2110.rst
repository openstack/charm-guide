New charm features
------------------

With each new feature, there is a corresponding example bundle in the form of a
test bundle, and/or a section in the `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_, that
details its usage. Test bundles are located in the ``src/tests/bundles``
directory of the relevant charm repository (see all `charm repositories`_).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The glance charm has acquired some new configuration options:

* s3-store-host
* s3-store-access-key
* s3-store-secret-key

instructions on performing the different upgrade types see `Upgrades overview`_
in the `OpenStack Charms Deployment Guide`_.

Getting started
===============

* The OpenStack Charms use Juju to deploy and manage OpenStack services, so
  getting to know Juju_ is a great first step.
* You might want to tryout the charms on your laptop using the Juju LXD
  provider and the
  `OpenStack on LXD bundle <openstack-on-lxd.html>`__
  if you don't have physical servers to use or just want to contribute a fix
  or change.
* For bare-metal deployment, Juju uses MAAS_ to provision and configure
  physical servers, so that's a good next step.
* Once you have MAAS setup, you can try out the
  `OpenStack Base bundle <https://jujucharms.com/openstack-base>`__ from
  the Juju charm store.

New Charm Features

a test bundle, and/or a `charm deployment guide <https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/charm-deployment-guide/latest/>`__ 
section which details the use of the feature.  For example test bundles, see the
src/tests/bundles/ directory within the relevant charm repository.

of the charm deployment guide for more details.

Upgrading charms
================

Always use the latest stable charm revision before proceeding with topological
changes, charm application migrations, workload upgrades, series upgrades, or
bug reports.

Please ensure that the keystone charm is upgraded first.

To upgrade an existing deployment to the latest charm version simply use the
'upgrade-charm' command, for example:

.. code:: bash

    juju upgrade-charm keystone

Charm upgrades and OpenStack upgrades are two distinctly different things.
Charm upgrades ensure that the deployment is using the latest charm
revision, containing the latest charm fixes and charm features available
for a given deployment.

Charm upgrades do not cause OpenStack versions to upgrade, however OpenStack
upgrades do require the latest Charm version as pre-requisite.

Upgrading OpenStack
===================

Before upgrading OpenStack, all OpenStack Charms should be running the latest
stable charm revision.

To upgrade an existing Steins based deployment on Ubuntu 18.04 to the Train
release, re-configure the charm with a new openstack-origin
configuration:

.. code:: bash

    juju config nova-cloud-controller openstack-origin=cloud:bionic-train

Please ensure that ceph services are upgraded before services that consume ceph
resources, such as cinder, glance and nova-compute:

.. code:: bash

    juju config ceph-mon source=cloud:bionic-train
    juju config ceph-osd source=cloud:bionic-train

.. note::

   Upgrading an OpenStack cloud is not without risk; upgrades should be tested
   in pre-production testing environments prior to production deployment
   upgrades.

See https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/charm-deployment-guide/latest/app-upgrade-openstack.html
for more details.
